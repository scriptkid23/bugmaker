Hello, I'm Hoan. The main purpose of creating this blog is that I'm lazy to read books, so I'm trying to find some motivation to read more.

It seems like I have a case of goldfish brain syndrome ðŸ˜°. So, I'm documenting the most interesting things I come across so that I can review them later and not forget. ðŸ˜˜
